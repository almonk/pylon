# Pylon - Declarative layout primitives for CSS & HTML

Pylon encapsulates Flexbox logic into a set of simple tags and attributes which, when combined, can form robust user interfaces using a declarative and expressive API.

**Pylon is:**
* Compatible with every JavaScript framework (it's just HTML & CSS)
* Easy to drop in next to any other CSS framework
* Easily configurable (see `tokens.css`)
* Requires no JavaScript framework (it's just HTML & CSS)
* Only 2kb

## Installation & usage
Please see https://almonk.github.io/pylon/

## Building locally
```
$ npm install
$ gulp pylon
```

If `gulp pylon` fails, you probably need to install the [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) `gulp-cli`:
```
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```
